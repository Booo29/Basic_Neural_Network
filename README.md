This project is a basic implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The network is trained on images of digits (0-9) and predicts the correct digit from a given image.

Features
1- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
2- Implements a simple feedforward neural network.
3- Trains the model on the MNIST dataset.
4- Evaluates the accuracy of the model on test data.
5- Saves the trained model for later use.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset of handwritten digits. It is freely available and widely used in the machine learning community.
